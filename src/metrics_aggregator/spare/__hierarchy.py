    Notes:
        We use all_neighbors() because the docs for JUNG's hierarchy
        implementation indicate to use getNeighbors() (see docs link
        above), which seems very similar to both neighbors() and
        all_neighbors(). The source for hierarchy conspicuously does
        NOT use getNeighbors(). It instead uses a method called
        adjacentNodes(). At the time of writing, the definition for
        this method cannot be found in the JUNG source except for
        overrides. adjacentNodes() appears to be getNeighbors() renamed.

    Organizational Measure discussed on p.62-64 of Burt's Structural
    Holes. JUNG just uses a value of 1, which Burt describes in ùë∂ measure
    method #3. Because JUNG uses 1, we have simply ommitted factoring in
    Organizational Measure in the below equation.
