    In Burt, see bottom of p.70 and p.71.

    Burt's formula:
        - Uses Coleman-Theil disorder index

        - First part is "the ratio of contact-specific constraint to the
          average in a relationship", which "shows" how much contact ùíãis
          a more severe source of constraint than other contacts":

            ratio = c_{ij}/(C/N)

            Where
                - "c_{ij} ... measures the constraint posed by contact j"
                - "N is the number of contacts in the player's network"
                - "C is the sum of constraint across all N relationships"

    Notes:
        We use all_neighbors() because the docs for JUNG's hierarchy
        implementation indicate to use getNeighbors() (see docs link
        above), which seems very similar to both neighbors() and
        all_neighbors(). The source for hierarchy conspicuously does
        NOT use getNeighbors(). It instead uses a method called
        adjacentNodes(). At the time of writing, the definition for
        this method cannot be found in the JUNG source except for
        overrides. adjacentNodes() appears to be getNeighbors() renamed.
