    Create a list of the core contributors of the given repository.

    Implements the Coelho et al. custom "Commit-Based Heuristic"
    algorithm: "the core team are those who produce 80% of the
    overall amount of commits in a project. However, as usually
    defined, this heuristic accepts developers with few
    contributions, regarding the total number of commits. For
    this reason, we customized the heuristic after some initial
    experiments to require core developers to have at least 5%
    of the total number of commits; candidates who have fewer
    commits are excluded."
