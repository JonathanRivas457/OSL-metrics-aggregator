				"body": "The biggest advantage would be that maximize would work next to do the docked window/AppBar.It might also be an interesting way to keep multiple Windows \"on top\" by making multiple AppBars.As someone who is often waiting for a task to be done or wanting to take notes, it's a convenient HUD that doesn't mess with \"flow\" because it's no longer a \"Window\" that gets in your way or that you move and forget about.I honestly don't know if the making the window an AppBar would violate the rule: \"don't mess with other app's windows\" but as much as FancyZones is great and has only gotten better I still find myself wanting this.________________________________From: Clint Rutkas ***@***.***>Sent: Tuesday, December 7, 2021 12:16 AMTo: microsoft/PowerToys ***@***.***>Cc: Jeff Jerousek ***@***.***>; Mention ***@***.***>Subject: Re: [microsoft/PowerToys] Add dock to desktop to any window (#71)@JeffJerousek<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJeffJerousek&data=04%7C01%7C%7C338d815c25404269fa8008d9b9492da9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637744546210863592%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=6Zgrziec%2B7DyKzEi9c0chQU4J4IoAEaOhL17gTEc3WY%3D&reserved=0> how would this differ compared to maybe a zone?â€”You are receiving this because you were mentioned.Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmicrosoft%2FPowerToys%2Fissues%2F71%23issuecomment-987602177&data=04%7C01%7C%7C338d815c25404269fa8008d9b9492da9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637744546210863592%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=8qbeLQ9i3C4g20x0ZBZ%2B4JV3doUe8%2BNJAg31Ji5GzCo%3D&reserved=0>, or unsubscribe<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnotifications%2Funsubscribe-auth%2FAJBGJW3SZ2KV735OCCQLJMLUPWRFXANCNFSM4HMEYYNQ&data=04%7C01%7C%7C338d815c25404269fa8008d9b9492da9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637744546210863592%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=fAO3p9bzIsAECpMTuCcpJCxoN%2BkngBTylVWfYEgQg4E%3D&reserved=0>.Triage notifications on the go with GitHub Mobile for iOS<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fapp%2Fapple-store%2Fid1477376905%3Fct%3Dnotification-email%26mt%3D8%26pt%3D524675&data=04%7C01%7C%7C338d815c25404269fa8008d9b9492da9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637744546210863592%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=3eqwvuCIqcBmpCntU4u%2Fu0nlgOK0USYENtVYabzr37E%3D&reserved=0> or Android<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.github.android%26referrer%3Dutm_campaign%253Dnotification-email%2526utm_medium%253Demail%2526utm_source%253Dgithub&data=04%7C01%7C%7C338d815c25404269fa8008d9b9492da9%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637744546210863592%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=XZ5kUit4lQecI8nAOM3uFuTDlHRfiwL1ampXqJc%2FioY%3D&reserved=0>.",

The left window is maximized and the taskbar isn't overlapped.https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/application-desktop-toolbars I understand now that this API is probably requires each app to implement it. Maybe a proxy type zone that we could designate an app bar but still drag windows in to.The Win8 style snap would be an interesting alternative.An always on top zone might work.When I've experimented with just regular windows and Xbox Gamebar widgets I always run into a situation where part of a windows I need gets lost under the always on top window. An always on top zone that was exclusive somehow, that didn't allow other windows to overlap it.",
